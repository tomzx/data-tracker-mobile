# Data Tracker Reminder

`Data Tracker Reminder` is a very simple data tracker application for your mobile device. You can create new groups of metrics you want to capture at a specific moment during the day. You can setup a reminder so that you are notified when it is time to enter data for those metrics.

You may want to track your weight daily, or your blood pressure and pulse. You might want to track other metrics such as your happiness levels on an hourly basis. What you decide to track is up to you, Data Tracker Reminder is here to help you record it.

`Data Tracker Reminder` uses the [data-tracker](https://github.com/tomzx/data-tracker) service to store data on a remote server.
